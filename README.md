# ini4j

Fork of ini4j library with patches needed for Consulo

Original project is located at https://sourceforge.net/projects/ini4j/

Requirements to build the lib in IDEA:
1. Set Maven to version 2
2. Configure Project to use Java 1.6 SDK
3. Set Language level to Java 6

Optionally:
- Create Run configuration to execute goals up to *package*. Further goals are not necessary for Consulo purposes.
- Change the pom.xml and src/changes/changes.xml to reflect lib version you need.
